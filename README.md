# Pig
A simple terminal based dice game.

# How To Play?
Pig is a very easy to learn, and play dice rolling game. The goal of the game is for 2-8 players to roll their way to 100. Each player gets a single 6 sided die to roll on their turn. You may roll as many times as you like on your turn to achive the highest score possible, but be careful! If you roll a 1, all of the points you earned on that turn will be lost. Knowing when to stop your turn will be a great benefit. This is a game of risk and chance. Once a player reaches 100+, 
the rest of the remaining players will take their turn for that round, and the player with the highest score above 100 will be awarded the winner.
